What's the smallest amount of steps (additions, deletions, and replacing) it would take to make the string "massivegargantuanhugeepicginormous" into "tinysmallmicroscopicinvisible"?

# pip install python-Levenshtein
import Levenshtein as L
L.distance('massivegargantuanhugeepicginormous', 'tinysmallmicroscopicinvisible')
